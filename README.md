# Service Marketplace Replica

This is an Expo React Native project configured as an **independent replica**.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Open a platform:

- Web:

  ```bash
  npm run web
  ```

- Android:

  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```

- iOS:

  ```bash
  npm run ios
  ```

> Note: the npm scripts use Expo offline mode (`--offline`) to avoid network-dependent dependency validation in restricted environments.

## Independent replica identifiers

- npm package name: `service-marketplace-replica`
- Expo app name: `Service Marketplace Replica`
- Expo slug: `service-marketplace-replica`
- iOS bundle identifier: `com.independent.servicemarketreplica`
- Android package: `com.independent.servicemarketreplica`

## Create a brand-new GitHub repo (no fork history)

## Independent replica setup

This repository is configured as an independent app replica with unique project identifiers:

- npm package name: `service-marketplace-replica`
- Expo app name: `Service Marketplace Replica`
- Expo slug: `service-marketplace-replica`
- iOS bundle identifier: `com.independent.servicemarketreplica`
- Android package: `com.independent.servicemarketreplica`

To keep it fully independent on your machine, avoid adding the original project as a Git remote.
